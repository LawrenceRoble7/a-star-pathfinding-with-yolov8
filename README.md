## Overview

This project integrates the A* pathfinding algorithm with YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model. The A* algorithm calculates the optimal path, avoiding obstacles identified by YOLOv8 in real-time. This combination enhances navigation systems, enabling efficient and dynamic route planning in environments with moving or static obstacles. Ideal for applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and interactive gaming.
